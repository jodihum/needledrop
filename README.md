This app is still a work in progress but I am making it public at this point because it is a demonstration of how to use SwiftUI, Combine, and CoreData, in an MVVM architecture.  Also it demonstrates how to write tests for these things. 

I used Rui Peres's tutorial as a guideline: https://www.raywenderlich.com/4161005-mvvm-with-combine-tutorial-for-ios

I am very happy to have suggestions on how to improve this. 

One thing I am not too happy with is having to import SwiftUI into some of my View Models because of the ViewBuilders.  If anyone has better suggestions please let me know.  Thanks.
